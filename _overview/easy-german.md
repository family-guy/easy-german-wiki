[Easy German]("http://easygerman.org/") is a YouTube channel designed to help those learning German as a foreign language. 

Usually videos are published roughly once a week, and last around ten minutes.

Each one exposes the learner to German used 'on the streets' and in everday life, as supposed to that taught formally in schools and universities, and has subtitles in English and German.

Easy German is a voluntary project (resources are free). However, you can [donate]("https://www.patreon.com/easygerman") (starting from very small amounts, e.g $1 per month) to the creators to help finance their work.
